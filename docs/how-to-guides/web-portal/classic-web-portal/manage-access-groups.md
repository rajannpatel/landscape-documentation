This document describes how to manage access groups.

## Create access groups

To create a new access group:

1. Navigate to your organization's home page
2. Click the **Access groups** tab
3. Enter the requested information
4. Click **Save**.

When you create a new access group, you must provide a title for the access group and a parent. The title can be whatever you want to name this new access group. The parent must be the global access group or an access group that is a child of global. If you want a flat management hierarchy, you can make every access group a child of global. Alternatively, you can use parent/child relationships to create a hierarchy of access groups. For instance, you could specify different sites at a high level, and under them individual buildings, and finally individual departments. Such a hierarchy allows you to specify groups of computers to be managed together by one administrator. Administrators whose roles are associated with higher-level access groups can manage all subgroups of which their access group is a parent.

When a new access group is first created, its administrators are those who have roles linked to its parent access group, but you can edit the roles associated with an access group. For more information, see [how to associate roles with access groups](#associate-roles-with-access-groups) in this guide.

## Edit access groups

When you delete an access group, its resources move to its parent access group.
