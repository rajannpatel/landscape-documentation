# Profiles

**Profiles** in Landscape are reusable sets of rules that define how Landscape should manage certain instances (machines and devices). Profiles are usually applied to groups of instances matching the tags and/or access group of the profile. Landscape automatically applies any relevant existing profiles to newly accepted instances. When an administrator modifies the tags or access group for an instance, Landscape automatically updates the set of profiles associated with that instance accordingly.

Once a profile is created, the access group associated with the profile cannot be edited.

Many profiles have a notion of **compliance**. When an instance becomes associated with a profile, Landscape will create activities to bring that instance into compliance with any profile associated with that instance.

Landscape has multiple types of profiles.

(reference-terms-package-profile)=
## Package profile

A **package profile**, or meta-package, comprises a set of one or more packages, including their dependencies and conflicts (generally called constraints), that you can manage as a group. Package profiles specify sets of packages that associated systems should always get, or never get. You can associate zero or more computers with each package profile via tags to install packages on those computers. You can also associate a package profile with an access group, which limits its use to only computers within the specified access group. You can manage package profiles from the **Profiles** page.

Package profiles are evaluated periodically, and can be used for ensuring compliance over time. If package profiles are used to install packages, it is important to ensure any prerequisite repository configurations have been applied so the package can be downloaded, otherwise the package profile will fail to install the package, and report the machine as non-compliant.

(reference-terms-reboot-profile)=
## Reboot profile
A **reboot profile** defines how and when Landscape executes system reboots on managed instances. Reboot profiles can automatically restart instances on select days of the week with a frequency of no more than once per week. Reboots can be staggered by configuring the delivery window. Reboot profiles are associated with instances using tags and an access group. You can manage reboot profiles from the **Profiles** page.

(reference-terms-removal-profile)=
## Removal profile

A **removal profile** defines a maximum number of days that a computer can go without exchanging data with the Landscape server before it is automatically removed. If more days pass than the profile’s “Days without exchange”, that computer will automatically be removed and the license seat it held will be released. This helps Landscape keep license seats open and ensure Landscape is not tracking stale or retired computer data for long periods of time. You can associate zero or more computers with each removal profile via tags to ensure those computers are governed by this removal profile. You can also associate a removal profile with an access group, which limits its use to only computers within the specified access group. You can manage removal profiles from the **Profiles** page.
(reference-terms-repository-profile)=
## Repository profile

A **repository profile** defines a set of pockets and APT sources for managed instances to use to source packages. When a managed instance is associated with a repository profile, the repository configurations are applied one time. Repository profiles don't perform ongoing monitoring of repository configurations. You can associate zero or more managed instances with each repository profile via tags. You can also associate a repository profile with an access group, which limits its use to only managed instances within the specified access group. You can manage repository profiles from the **Profiles** page.
(reference-terms-script-profile)=
## Script profile

A **script profile** defines how and when a script is automatically executed on managed instances based on specific triggers. It specifies the script, the user account that executes the script, the time limit, and a trigger that determines when the script runs. A script profile also defines which instances the script applies to, either through tags or to all instances within an access group. You can manage script profiles from **Scripts** > **Profiles** page.

(reference-terms-usg-profile)=
## USG profile

```{note}
Beginning in Landscape 26.04 LTS, "security profiles" were renamed to "USG profiles".
```

A **USG profile** defines how Landscape should monitor and manage security compliance on managed instances using the [Ubuntu Security Guide (USG)](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/security/compliance/usg/). USG profiles evaluate instances against established security benchmarks, such as CIS and DISA-STIG, to collect compliance data on a scheduled basis. With additional configuration, USG profiles can attempt to resolve detected compliance issues. USG profiles are associated with instances using tags and an access group. You can manage USG profiles from the **Profiles** page.


(reference-terms-upgrade-profile)=
## Upgrade profile

An **upgrade profile** defines a schedule for the times when upgrades are to be automatically installed on the machines associated with a specific access group. You can associate zero or more computers with each upgrade profile via tags to install packages on those computers. You can also associate an upgrade profile with an access group, which limits its use to only computers within the specified access group. You can manage upgrade profiles from the **Profiles** page.

(reference-terms-wsl-profile)=
## WSL profile

A **WSL profile** defines a single Ubuntu WSL instance that Landscape should install on Windows instances (host machines) in a given access group. You associate Windows instances with WSL profiles using tags. A profile can specify:

- Which Ubuntu distribution to install, either from the Microsoft store or from a custom image
- cloud-init configuration (optional)
- Compliance settings that specify how to interact with any WSL instances that were not created by Landscape

 Each Windows instance can be associated with zero or more WSL profiles.

WSL profiles are evaluated periodically for compliance. A Windows instance is considered **compliant** if the following are true:

- Landscape has installed a WSL instance on that Windows instance as specified by each of its associated WSL profiles, or the installation is in progress
- All Ubuntu WSL instances installed on that Windows instance were created through Landscape if any associated WSL profiles use this compliance settings

Landscape will alert you when a registered Windows instance is out of compliance with any of its WSL profiles. You can then take action to bring any non-compliant Windows instances into compliance with their WSL profiles.
