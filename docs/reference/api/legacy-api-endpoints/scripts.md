# Scripts


The methods available here are related to stored scripts.

## GetScripts

Retrieve stored scripts associated with the current account.

It also supports two optional arguments:

- `limit`: The maximum number of results returned by the method. It defaults to 1000.
- `offset`: The offset inside the list of results.

For example, the following request looks for stored scripts associated with the account and limits the result to 20 scripts:

```text
?action=GetScripts&limit=20
```

The method returns a JSON serialized list of scripts, like the following result:

```text
[
    {
        "creator": {
            "name": "John Smith",
            "id": 12345,
            "email": "john@example.com"
        },
        "interpreter": "/bin/bash",
        "title": "some script",
        "time_limit": 300,
        "username": "root",
        "id": 12345,
        "access_group": "somegroup",
        "attachments": [
            "file 1"
        ]
    }
]
```

## GetScriptCode

Retrieve the code portion of a given script.

- `script_id`: The id of the script you wish to get the code for.

The following errors may be raised:

- `UnknownScript`: No script with the given id could be found.

For example, the following request will get the code for a given script:

```text
?action=GetScriptCode&script_id=1
```

The method returns a JSON serialized representation of the new script:

```text
"import sys\nprint sys.version"
```

## ExecuteScript

```{note}
To use this API endpoint, you must have remote script execution enabled to run scripts on the target Landscape Client. For more information, visit {ref}`how to enable script execution <howto-heading-client-enable-script-execution>`.
```

Execute script on computers.

This method requires the following mandatory arguments:

- `query`: A query string used to select the computers to execute the script on. (See `query` under `GetComputers` for additional details.)
- `script_id`: The id of the script stored in the server.
- `username`: The username to execute the script as on the client. Required if the script has no default username.

It also supports an optional argument:

- `deliver_after`: Run the script after the specified time. The time format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.

For example, the following request will execute the Script with Id 19000 on all computers with the server tag:

```text
?action=ExecuteScript&query=tag:server&script_id=19000
```

The method returns a JSON structure with the activity that was created:

```text
{
    "computer_id": "None",
    "creation_time": "2012-11-26T23: 36: 20Z",
    "creator": {
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "id": 3,
        "name": "John"
    },
    "id": 155,
    "parent_id": "None",
    "summary": "Run script: foo",
    "type": "ActivityGroup"
}
```

The following errors may be raised:

- `UnknownScript`: No script with the given id could be found.
- `RequiresUserError`: The script does not have a user to run as, so the user must be specified when executing the script.

## RemoveScript

Remove a stored script.

This method takes one mandatory argument:

- `script_id`: The id of a stored script identities in the server.

For example, the following request removes stored script 1:

```text
?action=RemoveScript&script_id=1
```

The following errors may be raised:

- `UnknownScript`: No script with the given id could be found.
- `Unauthorised`: The user doesn’t have permission to remove the specified script.

## CreateScript
